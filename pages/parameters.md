# Parameters

Parameters are a standard method to configure a node.

Parameters and arguments are basically the same, but parameters are loaded into a Node, through the launch file, using hardcoded parameters or reading them from a file. Instead, arguments are values that we manually type to the terminal when launching a node and, normally, they are meant to replace the original values of the aforementioned parameters.

Normally, we will try to avoid using arguments, because they are not as flexible as parameters, and they result into very long and unpractical terminal commands.

You can find very complete examples adn definitions on how to use parameters and arguments for both, C++ and Python, in the following repo:
